Abstract
Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed machine learning approach that addresses confidentiality
and integrity concerns in various sectors, including Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. In order
to improve privacy protection and detection accuracy in decentralized systems, this study investigates the incorporation of
FL into Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). FL is especially useful in situations where data security and privacy are crucial
because it allows for the cooperative training of models without centralizing sensitive data. We examine many FL-based
IDS solutions across several domains, emphasizing how well they mitigate data breaches, maintain confidentiality, and
enhance intrusion detection capabilities. The use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), artificial immune systems,
and hybrid deep learning techniques to maximize IDS performance are among the current developments in FL methodology that are covered in the paper. We also look at issues like the requirement for effective aggregation procedures and
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Finally, we outline future directions and open research topics to
improve the scalability, resilience, and effectiveness of FL-based IDS solutions in practical applications.

Actions to undermine the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of a computer system or network, or to circumvent its security measures, are considered intrusions
[1]. As a result, there is a continuous search for innovative
and more efficient methods in the field of cyber security.
To effectively detect different types of attacks, an accurate
IDS is essential [2].
Recently, with the advances in the fields of Deep
Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), including
various unified models, these approaches have been widely
pursued in different fields such as cyber security [3],
computer vision [4] and healthcare systems [5, 6]. Again,
these algorithms can provide autonomous approaches to
identifying different types of attacks without human
intervention. For example, a paper published in 2020 [2]
used deep learning techniques on a large and unstable dataset for intrusion detection. Despite the large size of
the dataset, the class distribution is unbalanced. As this
imbalance affects the performance of the model, a data
sampling method was used. All of this was done on a
centralized system. Although IDS operation has been successfully used in approaches, it is usually used for all a

123

centralized system for processing data collected from users,
data privacy [7] issues arise.
Because of these challenges, the concept of FL, which
addresses the issues of privacy and learning on the local
device, has come to the fore [7]. FL allows devices to
connect and learn together without the need to send data to
a central server. That is, thanks to machine learning/deep
learning (ML/DL) capabilities, multiple devices and servers can be trained without the need for a centralized data
repository [8–10]. FL involves selecting a subset of clients
to assist in the learning process by distributing the current
global model to them. The architecture trains an ML model
on each client’s data independently. Each client then sends
its trained models to a central server, where these models
are aggregated to create a new model. The final model is
then sent back to the clients [7]. Figure 1 illustrates this
process. This iterative process continues until the target
level of performance is achieved. In essence, federated
learning relies on two core concepts: local updating and
global aggregation. This underlines FL’s emphasis on data
privacy, allowing clients to benefit from other clients’ data
without transferring it to a central server.
Although FL is being used more and more, the
approaches created to deal with its different facets are still
disjointed, which calls for a methodical examination. The
key challenges such as handling non-IID data, ensuring
model security during updates, and optimizing computational efficiency remain unresolved. Motivated by these
challenges, the solutions to enhance both security and
performance in real-world applications and the evaluation
datasets of FL-based intrusion detection techniques are
thoroughly reviewed in this work.
The following are the main contributions of this paper:

• We have systematically examined and compared various FL algorithms, including FedAvg, Fed0pt, FedProx, FedAdam, FedAdagrad, and FedYogi, to evaluate
their effectiveness in different IDS scenarios. Unlike
prior studies that focus on a single or limited selection
of FL techniques, our research provides a broader
perspective on algorithmic performance across multiple
datasets.
• We present an extensive experimental evaluation conducted on well-established cybersecurity datasets such
as Edge-IIoTset, CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD, KDD99,
and UNSW-NB15. This multi-dataset approach ensures
that our findings are robust and generalizable across
various real-world settings, setting our study apart from
works that rely on limited dataset evaluations.
• While many studies highlight the advantages of FL in
IDS, our work goes a step further by critically analyzing
key challenges, including handling non-IID data, mitigating the risks posed by untrusted participants,
optimizing communication overhead, and improving
model scalability. We propose future research directions that address these gaps, guiding the development
of more robust and practical FL-based IDS solutions.
The paper is organized into the following sections: Sect. 2
indicates a concise overview of malware and IDSs. Section 3 outlines the general architecture of FL. In Sect. 4, the
datasets utilized for intrusion detection are discussed.
Section 5 critically examines FL-based IDSs, presenting a
detailed description and comparative analysis of selected
methodologies. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and outlines future avenues for research.

2 Malwares and intrusion
2.1 Malware, malware types, and malware
analysis
The world is gradually moving into the digital age [11].
The use of computers, smart devices, and the internet is
increasing every day, and with these technologies come
new concepts such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. As much as the digital age brings innovation and
opportunities, it also brings threats and challenges in the
area of cybersecurity. In particular, malware has become
more dangerous as reliance on technology has increased.
Malware is malicious software used to disrupt the functioning of technology, such as computers, mobile, or IoT
devices, by accessing their systems and collecting critical
information on these devices. The first examples of malware were created for fun and experimentation. Today,
however, it is used to capture and damage sensitive personal or corporate information. According to studies,
thousands of new types of malware are being created very
quickly as technology advances [12]. Malware can be
categorized by function. The names and descriptions of the
most common types of malware are given in the table below Table 1 [13].
Malware, some types of which are listed in Table 1, are
analyzed to examine and understand them more clearly.
This is called malware analysis. With this analysis, it is
determined how malware software works, what kind of
damage it can cause, how it can be detected, and how it can
be neutralized [14]. The types of malware analysis are
presented in Fig. 2.

1. Static Analysis: In this type, malicious software is
examined without running. The source code, file
structures, and file content of the software are analyzed. Calculating the hash value of a malware file or
examining the machine code with disassembly tools
can be given as examples of static analysis. IDA Pro
and PEiD are examples of tools used for this analysis.
2. Dynamic Analysis: This analysis involves running
malicious software in a safe environment and examining its behavior. An example of dynamic analysis is
running the malware in a virtual machine and examining what files it changes, what system calls it makes,
or what network connections it makes. Cuckoo Sandbox, Process Monitor, and Wireshark are examples of
tools used for this type of analysis.
3. Memory Analysis: This type examines the activity of
malware in memory. Volatility Framework and Rekall
are examples of tools used for this type of analysis.
4. Code Analysis: This type of analysis involves a
detailed examination of the source code or compiled
code of malicious software. Examples of tools used for
this type of analysis include Radare2 and Ghidra.
5. Hybrid Analysis: In this type of analysis, static and
dynamic methods are combined. Firstly, the basic
characteristics of the malware are determined using the
static analysis method, and then the behaviors of the
malware during operation are examined using the
dynamic analysis method. FireEyemis an example of
the tools used for this analysis.
6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML-Based Analysis: In
this type, AI and ML algorithms are used to detect
malicious software. Examples of tools used for this
analysis are MalwareBazaar and VirusTotal.

2.2 Intrusion and intrusion types
Intrusion can be defined as unauthorized access to the
systems or networks of technologies such as computers,
mobile, and IoT devices. The definition of Intrusion is
visualized in Fig. 3. With intrusion, the attacker aims to
capture the user’s information, change the data, or disrupt
the system. As a result of Intrusion, companies, government organizations or individuals may experience serious
security risks. On the other hand, this situation can lead to
significant financial losses, loss of reputation, or legal
problems for the victim.
Intrusions can be categorized into types according to the
method, motivation, effects, and objectives of the attacker.
1. According to Attack Methods
(a)

Network-based Attacks: Such attacks are carried
out over the network. The goal is to damage the
network infrastructure. Examples of this type
include Denial of Service (DoS) [15], Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) [15], Man-in-theMiddle (MITM) [16] and Sniffing attacks [17].

(b)

(c)

Application-based Attacks: This type of attack
targets applications. The attack detects security
vulnerabilities in the application and provides
unauthorized access. This can lead to problems
such as unauthorized data access, information
theft, and system corruption. Instances of this
type of attack include SQL Injection [18], CrossSite Scripting (XSS) [4], and Remote File
Inclusion (RFI) [19].
Social Engineering Attacks: Human psychology
is the target of such attacks. Attacks are carried
out by manipulating people psychologically.
Examples include Phishing [20], Pretexting
[21], Baiting [21], and Quid pro quo [21].

2. According to Attack Motivations
(a)

(b)

Targeted Attacks: Such attacks target an individual, organization, or system. The attack is
intended to cause espionage, information theft,
or damage. Examples of this type of attack
include Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) [22]
and Spear Phishing [23].
Opportunistic Attacks: In this type of attack,
attackers do not select a specific target, but
instead target systems with security vulnerabilities. Examples of this type of attack include
Worms [13], Viruses [13], and Botnets [24].

3. According to the Effects of the Attack
(a)

(b)

(c)

Confidentiality Breaching Attacks: In such
attacks, confidential and sensitive information
is captured by unauthorized persons. Examples
include spyware [25] and Data leakage [26].
Integrity Violating Attacks: The goal is to
modify the targeted data or to disrupt the
integrity of the data. Examples include file
tampering [27] and data manipulation [28].
Availability Disrupting Attacks: The functioning
of systems, services, or networks is disrupted by
such attacks. Instances of this type of attack
include DoS and DDoS attacks [15].

4. According to the Attacker’s Objectives

(a)

(b)

(c)

Financially Motivated Attacks: In this type, the
goal is money. The attacker may steal the
victim’s credit card details or commit bank
fraud. Ransomware [29] is an example of this
type of attack.
Ideologically or Politically Motivated Attacks:
Such attacks are designed to achieve ideological
or political goals. Attackers may hack websites
to deliver social or political messages, or statesponsored attackers may conduct cyber-attacks
to steal confidential information.
Curiosity or Vandalism Motivated Attacks: The
purpose of these attacks is not financial or
strategic. They are usually harmless attacks
carried out to explore systems and gain knowledge and experience. Young attackers known as
script kiddies carry out these attacks.

(b)

IDSs, first introduced in the 1980 survey ‘‘Computer
Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance,’’ are software/hardware security tools used to eliminate threats that
may occur during data transmission, prevent unauthorized
access, and notify security personnel of attacks [30]. The
need for IDS can be explained by several reasons. Firstly,
These systems can detect attacks that other security
mechanisms cannot prevent. They also provide proactive
defense by responding to the analysis phase before the
attack occurs. Finally, IDS improves overall security by
enabling attack analysis, system repair, and remediation.
The advantages of IDS are as follows:
1. Early detection capability
2. Capacity for detailed information collection
3. Ability to provide high-quality evidence
However, IDS also has some weaknesses:
1. Vulnerability to fragmentation of packets and timingbased attacks
2. Confusion of the scan sequence
3. Packet hijacking
An incoming packet may be sent either for regular communication or with malicious intent. For this reason, it is
difficult to determine whether incoming packets are being
sent for attack purposes. IDS can be classified according to
various criteria:
1. Based on Architectural Structure
Host-Based IDS (HIDS): Operates on servers or
individual devices, monitoring their traffic, log
files, and transactions [31].

473

Network-based IDS (NIDS): Monitors all incoming network traffic, logs the content of each
packet, intervenes to block attacks when needed,
and produces reports [31].

2. Based on the Type of System They Protect
(a)
(b)

Small-Scale Systems: Designed for individual
computers or small networks.
Large-Scale Systems: Designed for corporate
networks and large-scale IT infrastructures.

3. Based on Data Processing Time
(a)
(b)

Real-Time IDS: Detects and responds to attacks
immediately.
Non-Real-Time IDS: Collects data and analyzes
it at intervals to detect attacks.

4. Based on Techniques Used

2.3 IDSs

(b)

Signature-Based IDS: Uses predefined attack
signatures to recognize known attack types [32].
Anomaly-Based IDS: Detects previously unseen
attacks by identifying deviations from normal
system behavior [32].

2.4 Intrusion detection techniques
Intrusion detection techniques (IDT) are various methods
used to identify malicious, unauthorized activity that may
be occurring in the network or system. These techniques
attempt to detect potential threats by analyzing system
behavior and network traffic [33]. IDT can be divided into
anomaly-based, behavior-based, signature-based, heuristicbased, ML-based, and hybrid. The writers of [34] presents
a survey of various intrusion detection techniques developed and/or researched between 2000 and 2019, including
the accuracy of the outputs. With the increasing use of the
internet, IDS have become a crucial component of network
security. The study highlights the difficulty of identifying
the best solution among the numerous available IDS
options and provides an inclusive overview of different
published solutions in this field. Table 2 shows the types,
definitions, advantages, and disadvantages of intrusion
detection techniques. Signature-Based Detection is used to
quickly detect known threats by utilizing predefined attack
signatures; however, it is effective only against known
attacks and has limited capacity to detect new or unknown
threats. Anomaly-Based Detection aims to identify
anomalies by analyzing normal system behavior, allowing
the detection of unknown attacks. However, changes in
normal behavior can lead to false positives, and it requires
high processing power. Hybrid Detection combines both
signature-based and anomaly-based methods to provide

3 Federated learning
Today, with the fast-paced advancement of Internet-based
technologies, users of these technologies are constantly
generating data [40]. The generated data are processed and
made more meaningful. States, institutions, or organizations that use meaningful data in areas such as security,
education, health, finance, etc. can analyze the situation
and help predict the future more accurately. Such effective

123

use of data enables acceleration of business processes and
increase in revenues [41].
On the other hand, the generated data containing personal information is of great importance in terms of privacy
[42]. Data stored and shared on servers raises various
security issues to protect data privacy. Countries have
made legal arrangements to meet the needs of data privacy
and data security. Without the consent of individuals, the
processing of personal information is limited by the Personal Data Protection Law (KVKK) and the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). Nonetheless, it is not
enough to rely only on legal regulations to ensure security
[43]. Technological solutions are also needed in practice to
ensure real security.
Federated Learning, developed by Google in 2016 to
address security concerns by ensuring data privacy, is a
new generation artificial intelligence technology [44].
Federated Learning is a technology designed for distributed
systems with clients and servers [45]. With this technology,
the data generated by the clients is not transmitted to the
server. Indeed, a model is trained locally using data generated on each client, and these trained models are then
transmitted to the server. The models transmitted to the
server are aggregated to form a centralized model. This

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

centralized model is then distributed to the clients [46].
Figure 4 exhibits how the federated learning architecture
works.
Data privacy is ensured by conducting model training at
the point of data generation (client) without transmitting
the data to the server. Additionally, sending the model
rather than client data to the server reduces network traffic
and communication costs, while also facilitating low
energy consumption and fast communication.
Based on the types of clients and the data they generate,
FL is categorized into two distinct types: cross-silo and
cross-device [47].
Cross-silo Federated Learning is an architecture where
clients are companies or organizations such as banks,
hospitals, etc. This architecture is used when the number of
clients is limited the data is sensitive and data cannot be
easily shared between different clients. Figure 5 exhibits an
example of a cross-silo FL architecture whose customers
are banks.
Cross-device Federated Learning is an architecture in
which clients consist of technological devices such as
computers, tablets, phones, wearable devices, etc. In this
architecture, the number of clients is more. An example of
this architecture can include mobile device applications.
Figure 4 shows the cross-device FL architecture.
In FL systems, there are two communication methods
centralized design and decentralized design. With centralized design, model parameters trained on clients are
transmitted to the server. Updates are functioned on the
server and sent back to the clients [48]. The communication between the server and the clients can either be synchronous [49] or asynchronous [50]. With decentralized
design, communication takes place between clients and
each client can update the central model parameters
immediately [51]. Centralized design is widely used.
However, decentralized design is also preferred because of

Page 7 of 25

473

the potential risks related to the collection of information
on a single server. But, designing a decentralized communication architecture is highly challenging.
The practical success of FL-supported IDS deployments
highlights the need for high-quality, unified datasets that
reflect real-world cyber threats. Several studies have
demonstrated the effectiveness of FL-based IDS in
improving detection accuracy while preserving data privacy. For instance, a multi-class IDS for software-defined
networking (SDN) achieved an impressive 98:6% detection
accuracy using FL with the Edge-IIoTset dataset [52].
Similarly, the FEDGAN-IDS approach, integrating
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with FL, significantly enhanced attack detection performance on datasets like KDD99, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15, reaching
up to 99% accuracy [53]. Another successful application,
the FedAGRU model, secured wireless edge networks by
training on non-IID data across multiple datasets, including
KDDCUP99, CICIDS2017, and WSN-DS, demonstrating
superior robustness and efficiency [54]. Additionally, the
GöwFed system combined FL with Gower Uniqueness
matrices to develop an adaptive, privacy-preserving IDS
framework for decentralized networks [55].
These applications emphasize the critical role of wellstructured datasets in FL-based IDS, reinforcing the need
for continuous dataset updates and new benchmarks that
capture evolving cyber threats and real-world
heterogeneity.

3.1 Model development with federated learning
A model training method developed for distributed systems
is the Federated Learning Architecture. In this chapter,
model training steps for centralized design are explained
step by step. These steps continue cyclically at certain

form of gradients or weights, are transmitted from each
client to the server.
• Collecting/Updating the Central Model on the Server
Model updates from each client are collected on the
server. Then these updates are merged and the central
model is obtained. In subsequent iterations, updates
from each client are merged in this step and then the
central model is updated.
• Deployment of the Central Model to Clients
The updated central model is deployed to clients.
The 1st iteration of the model training is completed.
Iterations are replicated a certain number of times or
until the model reaches a certain performance level.
With the updated model, each client begins the next
round of training.

intervals. In Fig. 6, the loop between the clients and the
server is visualized.
• Data Collection
Each edge/client generates and operates on its local
data. The data is not transmitted to a centralized server.
• Training Model on Clients
Each client trains the model utilizing locally generated data. In subsequent iterations, the model parameters received from the server are updated based on the
locally generated data.
• Sending Model Updates to the Server
The parameters of the trained model, typically in the

In the federated learning architecture, different cooperation
scenarios occur according to the data to be used for the
model to be trained. Solutions suitable for various data
partitioning scenarios have been produced for data structure and access limitations. The first of these solutions is
Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), the second is Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) and the third is Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL).
Horizontal federated learning: This method represents
a federated learning model where the data is divided horizontally between different clients. In this method, datasets
with the same set of attributes but with different samples
are included. Figure 7 shows an example of an application
of HFL. According to the figure, data from several institutions or organizations in different locations are stored on
computers. These computers are clients. The independence

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

Page 9 of 25

473

Fig. 7 Example of horizontal
federated learning

of the data sets (samples) shared between the clients poses
a significant challenge to model training for intrusion
detection systems. However, the similarity of attack attributes enables the development of common intrusion
detection models and approaches. As in the example shown
in Fig. 7, HFL is suitable for model training in cases where
the attributes of multiple datasets overlap to a large extent,
but the samples overlap less.
Vertical federated learning: This method is an FL
where the data is divided vertically between different clients. It covers datasets that have the same samples but
contain different characteristics. In Fig. 8, various types of
data belonging to the same individuals (samples) are distributed across multiple clients (such as an intrusion
detection system (IDS) deployed on a corporate network

and another IDS installed on individual user devices). This
means that identical individuals interact with the corporate
network and their devices. While the corporate IDS collects
data on network traffic and potential intrusion attempts
within the corporate infrastructure, the user device IDS
collects information such as device usage patterns, application behavior, and security events. As a result, the individuals are common to both clients, but the attributes
collected from each client are different. The model is
trained by combining the characteristics of the same individuals from both IDS clients. As in the example shown in
Fig. 8, VFL is suitable for training models in cases where
the user attributes of multiple datasets overlap minimally,
but the users (samples) overlap significantly.

Fig. 8 Example of vertical
federated learning

Federated transfer learning: This method is an FL that
aims to improve learning by transferring knowledge
between clients when both datasets’ features and instances
are different. It is used for organizations that have limited
data or want to improve model performance by using data
from different domains. In this method, datasets can be
divided both horizontally and vertically. An example
application of the FTL is shown in Fig. 9. There are two
different network environments in the scenario. The dataset
size of one environment is more limited compared to the
other. The model parameters developed using the data from
the environment with a larger dataset are shared with the
environment with a limited dataset. These shared model
parameters are fine-tuned using the limited data for optimization. This process enables knowledge transfer without
directly sharing any data. In cases where there is little
overlap between users and user attributes in two datasets,
transfer learning can be used to overcome data or tag
deficiencies instead of separating the datasets.

3.3 Privacy in FL
FL is a technique created to ensure data privacy by protecting information confidentiality. In this technique, the
data generated on the client is stored here. The trained
model parameters are transmitted to the server. Transferring model parameters to the server instead of data protects
the confidentiality of the data. However, it is very significant to the confidentiality and security of the model
parameters on both the client and the server side, especially
for applications using federated learning architecture in
sectors such as finance, health, and education. Even if the
data remains local, it can be reconfigured with updates
transmitted from the server to the client. Various measures
are taken to prevent this bad scenario from happening [56].
Cryptographic precautions include privacy-preserving
machine learning algorithms such as secure multi-party
computation (SMC) [57, 58] and homomorphic encryption
[59, 60]. Model parameters are encrypted before transmission. Differential privacy is one of the methods used to

provide data security. This is accomplished by introducing
noise into the data within extensive datasets [61].
The above methods mentioned in this study are independent of each other and can be used together [62–64].

3.4 Federated learning platforms
Many platforms have emerged for model development with
federated learning architecture [51]. The most preferred
ones are as follows:
1. TensorFlow federated (TFF): Offering the federated
learning features of TensorFlow, this platform enables
ML models to run on decentralized data [64].
2. PySyft: PySyft, an open-source FL library, is used for
secure and privacy-preserving distributed learning
operations [65].
3. Federated AI technology enabler (FATE): This platform provides privacy-preserving data analytics and
ML solutions to businesses and researchers [66].
4. PaddleFL (PFL): Developed by Baidu, PaddleFL
enables machine learning applications on large data
sets using federated learning techniques [51].
5. FedML: FedML is a comprehensive library that allows
users to easily deploy and manage federated learning
algorithms [67].

4 Datasets
Attackers utilize a range of methods to evade detection by
security systems or administrators. To create a robust
detection system, it’s essential to train the system using a
suitable learning method and a top-notch dataset. In academic works, several datasets exist, and this section aims to
provide comprehensive insights into these datasets through
a comparative analysis.

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

4.1 Common datasets
4.1.1 Kyoto
The dataset was created by Kyoto University between 2006
and 2009 and made available to researchers for intrusion
detection [68]. It contains a total of 24 features, of which
14 statistical features were obtained from the KDD Cup99
dataset and 10 additional features for use in the detection
system. The dataset was created with attacks captured
using honeypots (Windows XP, Nepenthes, Solaris 8 for
Intel, Others), darknet (darknet sensors), and other systems
(web crawler, e-mail server, and Windows XP).
Researchers conducted a thorough investigation of honeypots and darknet sensor data on a large number of real and
virtual computers, and they set up various types of darknets, honeypots, and other security mechanisms across all
these networks. The activities were carried out both outside
and inside the University of Kyoto, and the data collected
from the honeypots was used to create a comprehensive
report.
As a distinctive property from other datasets, in addition
to the normal and attack sessions, unknown datasets were
also encountered during the observation period. To distinguish this in the dataset, the value of 1 for normal data, 1 for attack data, and -2 for unknown data is assigned in the
‘‘Label’’ feature. Therefore, only multiclassification can be
done on this dataset. The advantages of the Kyoto dataset
over other datasets are as follows
• It contains more realistic data.
• It does not include features that contain repetitive data.
• Contains data of existing real networks.
4.1.2 NSL-KDD
Although the KDD Cup99 dataset remains a popular choice
[2], the rapid evolution of technology and networking
demands new datasets for developing novel models [69].
The limitations of current datasets hinder the achievement
of optimal performance by developed models. In response
to the deficiencies in the KDD Cup99 dataset, researchers
sought to construct a more contemporary and error-free
intrusion dataset. This effort led to the creation of the NSLKDD dataset, which, despite its own shortcomings in
accurately representing real network issues, offers several
advantages over the KDD Cup99 dataset:
• It does not comprise any records in the training dataset
that are not necessary.
• In the testing dataset, there are no instances of duplicate
data.

Page 11 of 25

473

• Both the training and testing datasets include a proportionate and appropriate number of records in each
category.
The NSL-KDD dataset includes 41 features, nine of
which are foundational, while the remaining 32 arise
from the KDD Cup99 and feature map. It retains critical
records from the KDD Cup99 and feature map,
categorized into four types:
• General features,
• Content features via TCP connections,
• Server-based traffic features with domain information,
• Time-dependent traffic features using ‘‘same server’’
and ‘‘same service’’ features.
Within the NSL-KDD dataset, attacks are categorized into
four types: U2R, DoS, R2L, and Probe, each with further
subcategories. Additionally, apart from attacks, there’s a
benign class available as well.
4.1.3 UNSW-NB15
It is a free dataset containing up-to-date real-world attacks
that were generated by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool at
ACCS’ Cyber Range Lab in 2015 [70] and contains
2,540,044 data points with 49 features, including 9 types of
attacks, ‘‘Backdoors, Fuzzers, Generic, Exploits, Port
Scans/Spam, Reconnaissance, Worms, Shellcode, Dos’’
using 12 algorithms with specific tools. The UNSW-NB15
dataset consists of six groups, which are as follows:
• Additional Generated Features are the features of
protocol and flow control.
• Basic Features are features that represent protocol
connections.
• Content Features are features of TCP/IP and HTTP
protocol connections.
• Flow Features are descriptive features between hosts.
• Labelled Features are the label information of each
data. In this feature the data information is kept as it is
attack 1 or normal 0.
• Time Features: These are time-dependent transaction
features, such as the arrival time of network packets or
the round-trip time of the TCP protocol.
4.1.4 CIC-IDS2017
Researchers have intensified their efforts to deliver effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as earlier IDSs have
demonstrated high accuracy rates. However, only a limited
number of IDS models and datasets have gained acceptance for real-world intrusion detection tasks. Addressing
this gap, the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity introduced
the CICIDS2017 dataset, which encompasses a wide range

123

473

Page 12 of 25

of attack scenarios and fulfills the requirements for realworld intrusion detection [71]. This dataset analyzes network traffic using time labels, protocols, source and destination IP addresses/ports, and various types of attacks. It
incorporates contemporary attacks based on actual data
from the real world. During the compilation of this dataset,
attacks and normal operations were conducted throughout
five days’ worth of traffic data.
• First day; Benign
• Second day; Benign, SSH-Patator, FTP-Patator,
• Third day; Benign, Heartbleed, DoS Slowhttptest, DoS
GoldenEye, DoS slow loris, DoS Hulk
• Forth day; Benign, WebAttack - XSS, WebAttack Brute Force, Infiltration, WebAttack - SQL Injection,
• Fifth day; Benign, PortScan, Bot, DDoS
were collected and stored in CIC-IDS2017 dataset, which
had been designed according to the following standards.
1. A network topology including various network
elements and operating systems is used.
2. A real-time attack was made with the help of various
tools from 12 different machines.
3. Data must be labeled.
4. System that communicates within the internal LAN
with two different networks and Internet
communication.
5. All traffic was seamlessly captured and saved to the
server.
6. The presence of all existing common protocols in the
network is ensured.
7. The most common intrusions were used.
8. Information on the hosts was recorded while the
attacks were taking place.
9. It should have many features.
10. Metadata is also made available.
It’s crucial to emphasize that an ideal Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) should have the ability to detect all types of
intrusions. For the creation of an optimal IDS, the complete
traffic data collection spanning all days should be amalgamated into a unified dataset.
The dataset comprises 83 features, 3,119,345 data
points, and 15 class labels (1 for normal and 14 for attack
tags). Furthermore, there are 288,602 data points with
missing class labels and 203 data points with incomplete
information within the dataset.
4.1.5 CIDDS-001
Coburg Network Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS-001)
was produced in 2017 as an example of an IDS dataset,
which is a labeled flow-based dataset, and was created for
the assessment of AIDSs [72]. The dataset focuses on

123

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

traffic data from two servers, which are OpenStack and
External Servers. A virtual small business environment has
been developed to create the CIDDS-001 dataset, which
includes typical servers such as clients, e-mail, Web, etc. It
provides unidirectional Netflow data and was developed
using the Python programming language to simulate
human behavior on simulated network virtual machines.
For this reason, the features of each user have been
adjusted to be realistic by using a configuration file. It
contains 13 features for classification and one feature as a
label or class.
4.1.6 CSE-CIC-IDS2018
For IDS implementations to develop better cybersecurity
systems, researchers are looking for high-quality and up-todate datasets. Therefore, the researchers at the Canadian
Institute for Cybersecurity, who examined the deficiencies
in previous datasets due to the need for a more detailed
dataset, designed and presented the CSE-CIC-IDS2018
dataset, which includes current attacks and a high number
of features from the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. In order to
construct the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset systematically,
the ‘‘Concept of Profile’’ was used, which implies containing thorough descriptions of intrusions on applications,
protocols, and low-level network elements when creating
and maintaining the dataset. To produce data items on the
network, these profiles may be utilized by agents or by
humans, and they can be applied to several network protocols with a variety of topologies and protocols. Additionally, when generating the dataset, the standards that
were utilized in the construction of the CIC-IDS2017
dataset were taken into consideration. It also took into
account the following properties:
1.
2.
3.
4.

It does not contain too much duplicate data.
The amount of NaN data is very low.
It is presented ready for use in CSV format.
Two profiles have been created to generate the dataset
which are Profile-B and Profile-M.

• Profile-B encapsulates the specific behaviors of users by
utilizing different ML and statistical algorithms. It
consists of the distribution of packet sizes of users, the
number of packets per stream, the size of the stream,
and the request time of a protocol.
• Profile-M distinctly identifies an attack scenario. In this
way, it helps other users to interpret it later.
In addition, 5 different attack methods were used to create
the dataset, except for the profiles. These are DoS, Brute
Force, Web, Botnet, and Infiltration attacks. It contains 80
features, including label information, and was gathered

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

Page 13 of 25

from numerous scenarios. These features include the
number of packets and bytes sent, the time it takes to send
each packet, the length of each packet computed independently in forward and backward order, and information
on whether or not there is an attack.
A complete dataset is presented to the users with
approximately 16 million records in PCAP and CSV format
[52]. The data in the PCAP format is raw data without any
feature extraction. Those who will examine the artificial
intelligence (AI) methods should use the CSV format
dataset, and those who will examine the feature extraction
methods should use the PCAP formatted dataset.
Table 3 presents the key characteristics of the most
favored and widely used datasets.
Improving existing datasets and developing new datasets adapted for FL-IDS is crucial for enhancing security
and detection accuracy in decentralized environments.
Existing IDS datasets often suffer from limitations like
class imbalance, outdated attack patterns, and a lack of
real-world heterogeneity. Addressing these issues through
improved data diversity, realistic attack simulations, and
integration of multimodal data sources such as host-based
logs and endpoint security data will enhance their applicability to FL scenarios.
Beyond improving existing datasets, there is a need for
newly designed metrics for FL-based IDS that ensure nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data
partitions, reflecting real-world deployment challenges.
Moreover, considering the significance of FL in these
areas, datasets capturing security threats in edge computing
and IoT environments are essential. A specialized adversarial robustness dataset simulating threats like model
poisoning and Byzantine attacks would also be valuable for
assessing FL-IDS resilience. Addressing these gaps will
significantly contribute to the development of more effective and privacy-aware IDS solutions in federated
environments.

4.2 Latest datasets
4.2.1 CIC-DDoS2019
CIC-DDoS2019 dataset includes modern Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and simulates real-world
network traffic. This dataset was created for the development and evaluation of new attack detection methods and
provides a DDoS taxonomy covering different types of
attacks.
DDoS attacks are attacks where the attacker floods the
target system with excessive traffic while hiding their
identity. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset categorizes these
attacks into two main categories:
• Reflection-Based DDoS Attacks The attacker
increases traffic towards the target by utilizing thirdparty legitimate systems.
– TCP-based attacks: MSSQL, SSDP
– UDP-based attacks: CharGen, NTP, TFTP
– Attacks using both TCP and UDP: DNS, LDAP,
NETBIOS, SNMP
• Exploitation-Based DDoS Attacks The attacker
depletes the target system’s resources using TCP and
UDP protocols.
– TCP-based attacks: SYN Flood
– UDP-based attacks: UDP Flood, UDP-Lag
The dataset includes labelled flow data CSV and raw PCAP
files for network traffic analysis. While creating the dataset,
it is aimed to create realistic network traffic. For this purpose, 25 user behaviours consisting of Ubuntu and Windows systems were simulated and natural background
traffic was created with protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS,
FTP, SSH and e-mail protocols.
CIC-DDoS2019 is one of the most comprehensive
datasets containing up-to-date and realistic DDoS attacks.
It serves as a crucial resource for network security

4.2.2 CIC-MalMem-2022
CIC-MalMem-2022 is a comprehensive and balanced
dataset designed to evaluate the detection of obfuscated
malware through memory analysis. Simulating real-world
scenarios, this dataset specifically addresses challenges
encountered in memory-based malware analysis. By
enabling the examination of obfuscated malware that
operates in memory and is difficult to detect, the dataset
provides extensive coverage of various types of malware. It
includes a diverse range of malware families categorized
into Spyware, Ransomware, and Trojan Horse, offering a
valuable resource for assessing and improving memorybased malware detection methods.
The dataset consists of memory dumps obtained using
debug mode, ensuring an accurate representation of realworld attack conditions. It maintains a balanced distribution, comprising 50% benign (non-malicious) and 50%
malicious memory dumps. With a total of 58,596 records,
the dataset contains 29,298 benign and 29,298 malicious
samples. This balanced distribution minimizes bias in
malware detection system evaluations, ensuring more
reliable performance assessments. By encompassing three
major malware categories, CIC-MalMem-2022 serves as a
crucial benchmark for researchers and security professionals in developing and validating memory-based threat
detection systems [75, 76].

5 Federated learning based IDSs
FL, a distributed ML method, has been extensively
explored in the literature. For instance, this method is
particularly valuable in industries such as IoT [77] and
Blockchain [78, 79], mobile network [80, 81], sales [82],
finance [83], transportation [84], and healthcare [85, 86]
where data privacy, security, and intellectual property
concerns prohibit the central aggregation of data [87]. For
additional applications in FL, we can refer to [88, 89].
The usage of FL in IDS can mitigate data privacy
concerns and minimize the risk of data breaches during
transmission. Further, federated IDS have shown promise
in improving detection accuracy by leveraging diverse data
sources without centralizing the data. For instance, in [90],
a multi-class IDS for software-defined networking (SDN)
utilizing FL for privacy preservation was suggested. To
perform the suggested model, they used a cyber securitybased dataset (Edge-IIoTset) which was created for IDS.
Further, the model was examined utilizing various evaluation metrics. According to the findings, a high score of

123

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

around 98:6% was obtained. When they compared the
existing literature, they arrived that their suggested model
ensures the confidentiality of training data by employing
FL and addresses the issue of inaccessible training data
resulting from privacy concerns. On the other hand, in
order to detect threats among 15 distinct attack types in the
Edge-IIoT dataset, Benameur et al. [91] employ CNNLSTM networks in conjunction with knowledge distillation
(KD) and achieve an accuracy of 84:5%. The research
paper by Song and Ma [92] proposed a novel approach for
intrusion detection in the context of edge-enabled IoT
using a federated attention neural network. In a recent
paper, an FL mechanism in the context of a privacy-enhanced edge intelligence model Beyond 5G networks was
defined. Afterward, an Artificial Immune IDS was developed to oversee and categorize nodes exhibiting anomalies
within the edge network, ensuring seamless and secure data
transmission according to the necessary standards. The
model, analyzed on the datasets CIFAR-10 and KDD-99,
outperformed the existing edge security models [53].
In [93], a proposal for an effective IDS utilizing a GAN
network with a distributed FL scheme (FEDGAN-IDS) was
suggested. The performance of the scheme in regards to
accuracy, recall, loss, convergence rate, precision, F1score, and AUC score was evaluated. By making use of
KDD99, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15 datasets, they
performed all experiments. Additionally, the outcomes
were summarized for both binary and multiclass classification of the scheme. An accuracy of 99% is achieved for
binary classification, while 98% accuracy is attained for
multiclass classification.
In [94], an ensemble-based method using XGBoost is
proposed to improve the detection of network attacks and
tested on the KDDCup99 dataset. The proposed method
achieved a high success rate with an accuracy of 99:95%
and demonstrated a more effective IDS model for detecting
unknown attacks. Similarly, the study proposes a novel
ensemble-based IDS method using an optimized CatBoost
classifier to enhance the security of 5G-enabled embedded
and cyber-physical networks. Experiments conducted on
the KDDCup99 dataset demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves an accuracy of 99:96%. This research
provides valuable insights into strengthening intrusion
detection capabilities in modern distributed networks [54].
Moreover, Bhati and Khari [95] proposes an ensemble IDS
method based on the voting ensemble technique, using two
algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVC) and ExtraTree.
The method was tested on the KDDCup99 dataset and
achieved an accuracy of 99:90%. The voting methodology
was found to outperform other ensemble techniques by
combining both similar and different classifiers to create a
stronger model. However, our work surpasses these references by leveraging FL to enhance intrusion detection

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

without requiring centralized data storage. Unlike traditional ensemble-based methods relying on XGBoost, CatBoost, or voting classifiers, which necessitate direct access
to extensive datasets like KDDCup99, our approach preserves data privacy and mitigates risks associated with data
breaches. Additionally, FL enables continuous learning
across distributed edge devices, ensuring adaptability to
evolving cyber threats while maintaining high detection
accuracy. Thus, our method not only matches or exceeds
the reported accuracy levels but also offers superior scalability, security, and real-world applicability in decentralized network environments.
The FL-enabled IDS approach is a significant subject.
Hence, Zhang et al. [96] offered an anomaly-based IDS for
Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks utilizing FL. They dealt with
training local models with non-IID. They implemented an
instance-based transfer learning method utilizing ensemble
techniques and introduced a new aggregation algorithm
related to a weighted voting mechanism. They used the
datasets CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. To compare a
centralized model in multiclass, they evaluated cloudbased AdaBoost and RF. Their approach demonstrated
superior detection performance. In a paper, they aimed to
present a thorough assessment of the usage of FL for IDS
in IoT based on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. By utilizing the CIC-ToN-IoT
dataset, three scenarios were created and Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and FPR metrics were explained. Further, by
utilizing the dataset, the FedAvg and Fedþ aggregation
functions were evaluated [97]. In [98], for ensuring the
security of wireless edge networks, an FL intrusion
detection algorithm (FedAGRU) was suggested. The difference from traditional centralized learning methods was
that it did not necessitate transmitting the original data to a
central server. In this study, three real network datasets
(KDDCUP99, CICIDS2017, WSN-DS) to analyze the
suggested method not only on IID but also on non-IID data
samples were utilized. The simulations determined that
FedAGRU demonstrated superior accuracy, robustness,
and efficiency. In [99], the application of FL to boost
malware detection in IoT networks was explored. Unlike
traditional malware detection methods, a decentralized
approach where IoT devices collaboratively train a shared
model locally, guaranteeing that sensitive data remains on
the devices was proposed. Therefore, the method improved
the detection accuracy while preserving user privacy. In a
scenario within a B5G context, the necessity arose to detect
cyberattacks impacting IoT devices, manage sensitive data,
handle Non-IID data, and engage with untrusted stakeholders or clients. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach using real-world IoT datasets,
highlighting its potential to provide a scalable and secure
solution for malware detection in IoT environments.

Similarly, in [100], a novel Fed-IDS was developed. To test
the proposed model under IID settings, IoT-ID-20, EdgeIIoT, and 5G-NIDD datasets were considered. Moreover,
the WUSTL-IIoT-2021 dataset was considered for evaluation of the model under non-IID data settings. When the
findings were compared to FedAvg, they emphasized a
marked enhancement in the performance of Fed-IDS.
By incorporating boosting approaches into a federated
learning framework, this research makes a substantial
contribution to the area with the goal of improving the
detection accuracy of cyberattacks in IoT systems. By
doing this, it tackles important issues with computational
efficiency and data privacy, providing a scalable solution
that can be adjusted to the varied and resource-constrained
nature of consumer IoT devices. The suggested approach’s
robustness and practical application are further demonstrated by the use of real-world datasets and thorough
evaluation measures [101]. Since the existing models in the
literature rely on outdated datasets like NSL-KDD, which
fail to capture contemporary IoMT attack vectors and limit
their real-world applicability, [86] leveraged a publicly
available modern dataset that comprehensively covers a
wide range of contemporary IoMT-based attacks.
In 2023, a federate-based IDS for IoT environments was
presented. To analyze the effectiveness, the dataset CSECIC-IDS2018 was utilized. In contrast to other studies in
the literature, this research opted to employ six FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedOpt, FedProx, FedAdam, FedAdagrad,
and FedYogi) for training instead of FedAvg. The experiments of evaluation metrics revealed that FL demonstrated
superior performance, particularly when dealing with small
local datasets, which is often the scenario encountered with
IoT devices [102].
A privacy-preserving FL model for IoT intrusion
detection was delivered in [55]. To test the effectiveness,
they performed comprehensive experiments on the NSLKDD dataset. The findings indicated that the system outperformed the distributed unaggregated on-device trained
models.
In [103], by utilizing a combination of CNN and GRU
deep learning techniques, a novel federated deep learning
scheme, named DeepFed, for industrial cyber-physical
systems (CPSs) was created. The findings demonstrated the
effectiveness of DeepFed using real-world industrial datasets, highlighting its potential to bolster cybersecurity in
industrial CPS environments. Similarly, the writers of
[104] used a method called clustered federated learning,
which helps the system learn from different sources of data
while keeping information private. The study’s experiments showed that this method is effective in identifying
and addressing security threats, which is a significant step
forward in industrial cybersecurity.Furthermore, Khan
et al. [105] presents a unique IDS paradigm known as

123

473

Page 16 of 25

federated-simple recurrent units (SRUs) to improve the
privacy and the security of IoT-based industrial control
systems (ICSs). In order to reduce computing expenses and
address the gradient vanishing issue in recurrent networks,
the suggested model makes use of an enhanced basic
recurrent units design. Experiments are carried out on a
real-scale gas pipeline network dataset, a representative
example of ICS networks, ensuring a robust and practical
evaluation. Numerous modern attack types, including
denial-of-service assaults, reconnaissance, sophisticated
malicious response injections, and command injection
attacks, are included in this dataset. The suggested federated-IDS model has performed better than other cuttingedge benchmark techniques when compared to baseline
methods. A clearer comparison would be possible by
specifically pointing out any shortcomings in the detection
strategy, model effectiveness, or ability to adjust to various
attack scenarios. Hence, this paper illustrates how filling
these gaps advances the field by increasing robustness
against new threats, decreasing processing costs, or
boosting accuracy.
In 2023, a new network threat detection system,
GöwFed, consisting of the combination of Gower Dissimilarity matrices and Federated averaging has been
developed. It uses FL to create a robust IDS that works
across multiple decentralized networks. With advanced
data encryption and secure model updates, GöwFed aims to
be more secure and privacy-preserving than traditional
ones. Developed in response to evolving cybersecurity
threats, GöwFed offers an adaptive and secure IDS
framework. This system contributes to ongoing research in
federated learning, providing a practical solution to the
limitations of existing IDS technologies [106].
In the research, Al-Marri et al. [9] suggested a novel
method that employs mimic learning within FL framework
to address the issue of reverse engineering in FL, thereby
reducing the risk of compromising users’ privacy in IDS.
Unlike traditional centralized IDS, this approach trained
models locally on user devices, keeping sensitive data
secure and mitigating reverse engineering risks. They
employed the NSL-KDD dataset to evaluate the suggested
method in comparison with current solutions. Techniques
such as secure aggregation and differential privacy were
also employed to further ensure data privacy and robustness, making this a promising solution for modern IDS.
A hybrid approach consisting of a combination of CNN
and Bidirectional Long-Term Short Memory (BiLSTM)
was introduced for efficiency. Similar to other studies in
the literature, the objective was to assess the efficiency
within the framework of FL for IoT. To achieve this,
CICIDS2017 and Edge-IIoTset real-word datasets were
utilized for evaluation [107].

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

Amiri-Zarandi et al. [108] established the Social Intrusion Detection System (SIDS), an FL-based scheme for IoT
intrusion detection utilizing the Social Internet of Things
(SIoT). The presented method utilized the social connections between objects within a system to offer a collaborative mechanism that preserved privacy while detecting
intrusions in IoT environments.
To enhance learning efficiency across different attack
categories, a novel FL-based intrusion detection method,
named MV-FLID, has been developed. This approach
leverages multi-view ensemble learning to analyze diverse
perspectives of IoT network data. By training in a distributed manner, MV-FLID effectively identifies, categorizes, and safeguards against various attacks [109].
Some researchers have used sophisticated ML models,
including autoencoders, to extract significant aspects from
client data in order to increase its efficacy. Pope et al.
[110], for instance, showed how FedAvg and autoencoders
might enhance anomaly identification in IoT networks. An
innovative unsupervised DP method utilizing autoencoders
for learning from unlabeled data has been introduced. By
leveraging FL, this method trains on the unlabeled datasets
of edge devices while preserving user privacy. Yadav et al.
[111] conducted experiments using the CICIDS 2017
dataset, achieving an impressive 97:75% accuracy in
detecting intrusions.
To protect data privacy, an FL-IDS was considered in
terms of transportation IoT [112]. The real-time effectiveness of the system was assessed by making use of
datasets NSL-KDD and Car-Hacking. When compared to
traditional approaches, the system was found to be successful in terms of accuracy and loss.
Designed to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving
collaborative IDSs in IoT, Sarhan et al. [113] established a
hierarchical blockchain-based FL framework: HBFL.
Using a key IoT dataset to evaluate its performance, the
study demonstrated that HBFL is a robust and high-performance ML-based IDS. This framework effectively
protects and maintains the integrity of IoT networks.
In another study conducted by Sarhan et al. [114], a
Cyber Threat Intelligence sharing model utilizing FL was
introduced to enable multiple organizations to unite in
designing, training, and evaluating a robust ML-based
network IDS. To evaluate the model, NF-UNSW-NB15-v2
and NF-BoT-IoT-v2 datasets were analyzed. Further, a
centralized model and a localized model were considered
as scenarios in the evaluation process. The outcomes
demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the model.
The advancement of smart grid technologies have
introduced security vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures
such as smart meters. Several methods have been presented
to enhance security in such systems. For instance, Mirzaee
et al. [115] presented a Federated IDS (FIDS) method,

Cluster Computing (2025) 28:473

focusing on intrusion detection in 5G smart metering
networks.
Communication delay is the primary performance bottleneck in the entire learning framework. Hence, to address
the communication delay limitation of FL, an IDS based on
FL, Dynamic Weighted Aggregation Federated Learning
(DAFL), was established by Li et al. [116]. This approach
improved intrusion detection while reducing communication overhead.
Unlike other studies in the literature, Neto et al. [117]
examined the statistical obstacles in FL. They developed a
selection approach named Federated Score-Based Selection
(FedSBS). It involves two steps: choosing participants and
using an aggregation algorithm that taps into global
momentum. The suggested method was assessed by utilizing the CICIDS2017 dataset. In order to test the method,
they used FedDyn, FedAGM, and SlowMo algorithms.
Afterward, they assessed the accuracy score, precision
score, recall, and F1 score for the test validation sets. By
achieving an accuracy of 92% and 82% F1-Score in scenarios where there were no malicious participants, their
approach showed superiority.
In recent years, other surveys on FL have been conducted. For example, Agrawal et al. [118] summarized the
usage of FL in IDS highlighting the security, privacy, and
reliability dimensions. Similarly, in the survey written by
Lavaur et al. [119], a fascinating taxonomy concerning the
coverage of FL-IDS systems in aspects such as privacy,
trust, cybersecurity awareness, and related factors was
presented. The recent practical applications of FL were
analyzed by Zhang et al. [120]. According to this survey on
FL, some applications related to service recommendation
and wireless communication were summarized. A current
survey in Healthcare Metaverse highlighted that it utilizes
FL, allowing individual hospitals to collaborate and learn
from shared predictive models. The advantages of FL in
the Healthcare Metaverse are examined. Following this,
they explored various applications, such as medical diagnosis, infectious disease management, and patient monitoring. To the end, they emphasized the major challenges
and potential solutions for implementing FL in the
healthcare Metaverse [121]. In order to solve privacy,
security, and reputation issues in Healthcare systems, Khan
et al. [122] introduced a novel security model for the collecting and transmission of biomedical data. They developed an enhanced SRU network to address fading gradient
problems and increase learning by lowering computing
costs, and they presented a threat-vector database based on
the dynamic behaviors of smart healthcare systems. When
compared to current techniques, the model reduces communication overhead and improves feature extraction.
However, one drawback that restricts scalability is its
reliance on huge datasets. Finally, the recently published

paper [123] provided a detailed review and taxonomy of
existing FL-based IDS approaches, identified current limitations, and suggested future research directions, highlighting the potential of FL to enhance threat detection
while preserving privacy and reducing communication
overhead.
Table 4 demonstrates that prior studies have shown the
effectiveness of FL for IDSs under different scenarios.

6 Discussion
Federated learning (FL) has great potential to enhance
intrusion detection systems (IDS) by addressing confidentiality and integrity concerns. By eliminating the need for
centralized data collection and integrating data from various sources, FL can improve detection accuracy while
safeguarding privacy. Techniques like secure aggregation
and differential privacy, used in conjunction with FL, have
proven to be effective in industrial cyber-physical systems
and healthcare applications. Specifically, innovations like
FedSBS and FEDGAN-IDS achieve high accuracy and F1
scores through aggregation methods like FedAvg and
Fedþ.These results indicate that FL can successfully learn
from decentralized data sources without requiring centralized data storage, ensuring both data privacy and model
robustness.
When compared to traditional centralized IDS models,
the FL-based approach demonstrated superior scalability
and resilience in handling large volumes of distributed
data. Traditional methods struggle with privacy concerns
and data centralization, whereas FL circumvents these
issues by keeping sensitive data local. Moreover, FL’s
ability to work with non-IID data further enhances its
applicability in real-world scenarios, where data distributions often vary across devices and networks.
However, several challenges and research gaps must be
addressed before FL can be widely adopted. The variety
and quality of data used in FL play a crucial role in the
results. Inconsistent data from different devices can negatively impact model performance, underscoring the
importance of data preprocessing and standardization. The
heterogeneous nature of IoT devices presents additional
challenges, and optimized FL methods for these structures
are needed. FL claims to be secure and private, however
further research is required to address vulnerabilities during model updates and data transfers, especially concerning
resilience against malicious actors. Additionally, computational costs, training processes, and real-time application
performance must be improved to make FL more efficient
and effective.
Addressing the challenges in FL-based IDS requires
concrete strategies to enhance model efficiency, scalability,

and robustness in real-world deployments. One effective
approach is adopting adaptive aggregation methods, such
as instance-based transfer learning and weighted voting
mechanisms, which improve model accuracy in non-IID
data scenarios, as demonstrated in anomaly-based IDS for
Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. Additionally, lightweight
FL models adapted for resource-constrained environments,
such as Federated-Simple Recurrent Units (FedSRU) and
clustered federated learning (CFL), have been proposed to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining high
detection performance.
To enhance privacy, secure model update techniques
like differential privacy and homomorphic encryption can
mitigate risks associated with malicious participants in FL
networks. Moreover, knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, such as those used in CNN-LSTM networks, allow
edge devices to benefit from complex global models
without excessive local computation, ensuring scalability
in large-scale IoT environments. Finally, communicationefficient FL algorithms, such as Dynamic Weighted
Aggregation Federated Learning (DAFL), help reduce
network latency and training costs, making FL-based IDS
more feasible for real-time applications.
Implementing these strategies will enhance the effectiveness of FL-based IDS, ensuring they remain robust,
scalable, and privacy-preserving across various cybersecurity contexts.

healthcare systems, industrial control systems, and IoT
environments, where the proposed methods have shown
superior performance in detecting intrusions, reducing
computational overhead, and ensuring secure data transmission. The experiments conducted on various datasets,
including Edge-IIoTset, CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD, KDD99,
and UNSW-NB15, and employing FL algorithms like
FedAvg, Fed0pt, FedProx, FedAdam, FedAdagrad, and
FedYogi, demonstrate the ability of FL to achieve high
accuracy rates, with some methods reaching up to 99:27%.
These results showcase the potential of FL to improve the
performance of IDSs while maintaining robust privacy
protection.
Despite the promising results, there are still open challenges that need to be addressed, such as managing
untrusted participants, enhancing the scalability of FL
models, and maximizing the trade-off between computing
costs and communication. Future studies should focus on
creating FL algorithms, exploring advanced privacy-preserving techniques, and addressing the challenges of realworld implementation.
In conclusion, FL-based IDS represents a significant
advancement in cybersecurity, providing an efficient and
privacy-conscious approach to protecting critical systems
and data from evolving threats. Maintaining the security of
our increasingly interconnected world will require these
systems to be continuously improved.

In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive overview
of Federated Learning (FL) based Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDSs), highlighting their importance in addressing the escalating security and privacy issues with data,
particularly in distributed environments like IoT, healthcare, and industrial networks. FL offers a promising solution for enhancing IDS performance by enabling
collaborative learning across multiple decentralized devices while ensuring that sensitive data remains local and
protected.
We have examined various approaches and applications
of FL in IDS, noting significant advancements such as the
incorporation of deep learning techniques, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), and hybrid models for
improving detection accuracy and robustness. Additionally,
FL’s ability to manage non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data, a common challenge in realworld scenarios, was emphasized, along with the various
privacy-preserving techniques integrated into these models.
